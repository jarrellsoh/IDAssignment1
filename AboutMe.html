        See the highest guy in the picture? That's me! This picture features my ODAC CCA members back when I was
        Secondary
        2,
        and when I did not have much experience in the CCA. Now that I've graduated from Maris Stella High School, my
        Secondary School,
        I look back and I realise that ODAC was one of the best things that happened in my life so far. It taught me
        many
        soft skills like
        Determination, Perseverance and Teamwork. Now that I'm studying Information Technology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
        these values help
        me a huge amount whenever I do assignments, study for tests etc.<br><br>
        As for now, I am a National Athlete for Sport Climbing, while being a full-time student. While it might be tough
        to cope sometimes,
        I have never regretted making this decision as it has taught me many different things including time management
        and nutrition among
        other things. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy looking through my portfolio and feel free to leave some feedback
        in
