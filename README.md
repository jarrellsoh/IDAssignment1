My assignment 1, a personal portfolio
Jarrell's Personal Portfolio
This website is a my personal portfolio where I showcase the achievements over the years. This website is aimed towards anyone who might be interested in me, be it for work or other purposes, and is where they can get a quick glimpse of what I have achieved. 

Design Process
I started this project with a goal to make a website where people can take a look at my achievements and get to know me just by scrolling through the website.
I believe that I was successful in doing so as my website is quite short and simple, but still manages to get my points across without sacrificing much of the aesthetics.

User Stories: 
-As an employer, I want to use this website in order to get to know my employee more and figure out his strengths, so I can decide if he is suitable.
-As a fellow co-worker, I want to view the site to understand my co-worker more and find out what kind of interests he has, what is his backstory etc. 

In my assignment folder, you will see my wireframe made from AdobeXD. Though it might not be as good as the final website, it acted as a good guideline for where everything should go and helped with planning what should be inside the website and where it should be. 

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - The layout of some of the pages change according to the device used. After becoming smaller than a set width, the media query used optimises the page for anything smaller than that set size. 
Feature 2 - When the website goes into mobile view, the navigation bar turns into a pop-up bar that can be accessed by clicking on the "burger" icon at the top right hand corner. The sidebar is animated to pop out smoothly to enhance user experience. 
Feature 3 - The navigation bar allows the user to go to whatever page they like simply just by clicking on that page name, making navigating through the site easy and user-friendly. 
Feature 4 - The social media icons at the bottom of the website also allows people to navigate to my personal social media sites by clicking on the respective icon, allowing them to quickly go to my social media sites if they wish to do so. 
Feature 5 - The contact me page has a form that the user can fill up to inform me of their contacts in case they want me to contact them, then submit it by clicking to submit button. The inputs are validated before submission and will inform the user if there are any invalid fields.

Features Left to Implement
Feature 1 - Add interactive elements throughout the website to make it more appealing and interesting to the public. This can be done by animating various options in the website.
Feature 2 - Add drop down bars to each of the navigation bar links that will bring the user to that particular section of the website. 

Technologies Used
This website uses html, css and javascript. 
html determines the content and what goes into the website. 
css makes up the design of the website and dictates what should go where. 
javascript helps to implement complex and interactive features onto the website.

Contact form:
The form will prompt the user if an invalid input is dound in the form. If any part of the form is empty, the user will be prompted to enter information into it. If an invalid input is found, the user will be propted to change it into a valid input.  For example, if the user does not put @ in the email portion, he or she will be promted to do so by the website. 
The form is optimised to appear in suitable places according to screen size, and works the same accross all sizes.
